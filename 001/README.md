# :trophy: Challenge 1 - "Lights!" (Easy) :bulb:

## Problem:

The clubhouse has been understandably pretty quiet of late, but at last, life is slowly returning and the office is alive once again with the sound of busy ANDis. There's a smart-lamp in the corner of the room which is only turned on when somebody is in the room. Given a set of intervals which describe the entrance and exit times of ANDi's in minutes, your task is to write code to determine how many minutes the light has been on for in total. The input data is provided here.

- :three: Points are awarded for submitting a working solution
- :three: Further points are awarded for using a language/framework which no other participants use
- :four: Further points are awarded for a solution under 400 bytes of code

## Example:

For the following set of intervals:

```
[2,5]
[4,8]
[10,13]
```

The expected output is: `9`

## Submission:

When you're confident that you have the correct answer, check using the /check command here on Slack. When you're happy with your solution, submit a link to your source code repo using the /submit command. Submission closes noon 5th May
Good luck!
